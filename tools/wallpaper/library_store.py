r"""Durable location-library store — records, crash-safe embedding shards, LRU field cache.

The persistence layer under the Phase-1 prospecting loop (`prospect_orchestrator.py`).
Everything here is **pure I/O + numpy** — NO GPU, NO torch, NO render — so it unit-tests
without a model. The GPU annotate tail (`library_annotate.py`) computes vectors/thumbnails
and hands them here to persist.

Three durable artifacts, all surviving `rm -r out/*` (they live under `data/`):

  data/library/records.jsonl                 append-only, one JSON record per LOCATION.
                                             `location_id` is the primary key; appends
                                             DEDUP on it, so re-running a cycle adds 0
                                             duplicates (resume idempotence).
  data/library/thumbs/<location_id>.jpg      384x216 grayscale thumbnail per location.
  data/library_embeddings/shards/            per-cycle npz shards (morph_uids + morph_clip),
    <run_id>__cycle_<NNN>.npz                written tmp+atomic-rename so a hard-kill mid-
                                             write never truncates a prior shard. A loader
                                             CONCATENATES the base embeddings.npz + every
                                             shard into one logical uid->vector store.

Embedding-append design (chosen: SHARD-PER-CYCLE, not in-place rewrite).
  The existing `data/library_embeddings/embeddings.npz` (62 curated morph rows + 564 colored)
  is the immutable BASE. New library locations append as one small npz per cycle under
  `shards/`. Rationale over "rewrite embeddings.npz in place each cycle": (1) crash-safety by
  construction — a kill can only corrupt the in-flight tmp shard (np.load fails -> loader
  skips it -> resume re-derives that one cycle), never the base or a prior shard; (2) O(cycle)
  append cost stays flat over a days-long run instead of rewriting an ever-growing monolith;
  (3) `by-reference keying` is preserved because records key descriptors by UID (== location_id),
  and the loader resolves uid->row across base+shards (last-writer-wins), so a global integer
  row index is never needed. morph_v6 is intentionally absent from shards (the grayscale v6
  prelogits were PROMOTED verbatim in the old store, not computed; recomputing them for a fresh
  location is not free -> skipped, per the build spec; v6 location-potential still rides the
  ledger join).

Field-cache retention (LRU under a GB cap). Retained smooth fields make Phase-2 colorize cheap.
  Kept under `data/library/field_cache/` (survives out/* wipes, unlike the disposable seeder
  scratch) but LRU-EVICTED under `--field-cache-gb` so it can never become an unbounded sink.
  Fields are deterministic from coordinates, so eviction costs re-dump time, never data. The
  cache key reuses the canonical `location.field_mode_token` + geometry tokens (see `field_stem`)
  — the same scheme deploy_tail keys its token'd dumps by — so no parallel cache is invented.
