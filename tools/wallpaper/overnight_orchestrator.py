r"""Overnight emission orchestrator — unattended fresh-discovery -> eval-res emit loop.

Runs the emission chain continuously under a wall-clock cap for morning review. Each
CYCLE is: fresh discovery (production_seeder, all families, run-scoped ledger) -> pool
build (build_fresh_discovery over ONLY this cycle's fresh q3s) -> emit (emit_v1
--eval-res). Wallpapers + a durable aggregate manifest accrue every cycle, so a crash at
hour N keeps hours 1..N.

The three load-bearing invariants (see prompts/pipeline_orchestrator_prompt.md):

  1. GPU-EXCLUSIVE, DECOUPLED PHASES. Each phase is a child process that fully EXITS
     (releasing all GPU memory) before the next starts. Only ONE GPU consumer is ever
     resident. GPU residency is sampled (nvidia-smi) at every phase boundary and logged;
     a phase that leaves memory resident after exit is flagged as a suspected leak.

  2. FRESH-GENERATION ENFORCEMENT (non-negotiable). At run start a FRESH, EMPTY
     run-scoped discovery dir is created; discovery writes ONLY there (--discovery-dir);
     each cycle's pool reads ONLY that ledger, past a per-cycle line watermark
     (--ledger-start-line), so it pools ONLY the q3s that cycle's discovery just
     appended. An empty run ledger physically cannot contain a banked/historical q3. A
     per-cycle ASSERTION re-derives, from each pooled row's provenance.source_oid, that
     every pooled location originates from a ledger row this run wrote — the run HALTS on
     any violation.

  3. WALL-CLOCK CAP at the finest safe boundary: between phases, per discovery family,
     and (via emit_v1 --limit) per emit render. A unit that cannot finish in the
     remaining budget is never started. A hung unit (> KILL_MULT x its expected time) is
     hard-killed (process tree) and the loop continues.

Families: the c-plane families (mandelbrot, multibrot3/4/5) each with --julia-hook (adds
the julia:{fam} twins) run through the c-plane radius-rejection loop (`--run`). Phoenix has
NO parameter plane to prospect (resolve_family rejects --phoenix under --run), so it can't
ride that loop — but it IS freshly discoverable, just via a different recipe: a dedicated
phoenix phase runs the native z-plane descent (`--run-phoenix`) into the SAME run-scoped
ledger at its provisional t_good=0.18. That completes the 9-family set. Phoenix is a
low-yield, variety-poor garnish (~7 descents/keeper), so its phase gets an elevated-but-
bounded per-cycle descent budget (PHOENIX_PER_CYCLE_MIN) and its share of each emit pool is
capped by build_fresh_discovery's family-balanced round-robin (it can't dominate the loop).
