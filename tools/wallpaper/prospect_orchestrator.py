r"""Phase-1 prospecting orchestrator — unattended fresh-discovery -> location-LIBRARY loop.

Same loop as `overnight_orchestrator.py`, different tail. Each CYCLE is: fresh discovery
(production_seeder, all 9 families, run-scoped ledger) -> pool build (build_fresh_discovery over
ONLY this cycle's fresh q3s) -> fresh-isolation assert -> ANNOTATE + PERSIST LIBRARY RECORD. There
is NO emit phase: `emit_v1` is never called, nothing renders at wallpaper res. Instead every fresh
q3 location accrues a dense-cheap library record (identity + v6 location-potential + grayscale
morphology CLIP + thumbnail) into a durable store that survives `rm -r out/*`.

REUSED VERBATIM from the overnight orchestrator (imported, same code objects — the strongest
"behaves identically" guarantee): the run-scoped discovery dir + fresh-isolation assert, the
per-phase fully-exiting child processes (GPU freed between phases) + per-phase failure isolation,
the idempotent `state.json` + `--run-id` resume, the wall-cap discipline (never start a unit that
can't finish; 3x hard-kill backstop), and `purge_cycle_intermediates` at cycle boundaries. The
discovery + pool phase invocations and the fresh-isolation assertion are the SAME functions.

Fresh-generation (load-bearing, unchanged): every record originates from THIS run's empty
run-scoped ledger; the run-start emptiness precondition + per-cycle assert physically forbid a
banked/historical/earlier-cycle location reaching the store. Accumulating fresh records ACROSS
runs into the one library store is intended; each record carries run_id + source_ledger so the two
are distinguishable on inspection.

    # validate first (short throwaway mini-run; backgrounded):
    uv run python -u tools/wallpaper/prospect_orchestrator.py --mini
    # a real run spread over many short sessions (the budget is ACCUMULATED active time, so idle
    # days between sessions cost nothing; --total-cap-hours is adjustable on resume):
    uv run python -u tools/wallpaper/prospect_orchestrator.py --run --run-id myrun --total-cap-hours 24
    # ...later, more of the SAME run (resume by --run-id); stop it gracefully mid-session by
    # `touch out/wallpaper/prospect/myrun/STOP` — it exits cleanly at the next cycle boundary.
