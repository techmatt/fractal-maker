"""Merge quality-passing extracted palettes + curated q2/q3 into the durable
preference-network palette pool, re-type under the binary cyclic/non_cyclic rule,
and report the (type x source) contingency table.

  uv run python tools/palettes/build_pool.py

Read-only against all existing sources (survey, harvest, curated libraries). Writes:
  * data/palettes/pool_colormaps.json   -- the merged pool (list; loads through the
    existing feature-module / colormap loaders with no loader changes).
  * data/palettes/palette_features.json  -- REGENERATED over the full merged pool
    (overwrites the old 76-entry q3-only file) so colormap.py's type lookup resolves
    for every pool entry.
  * out/palettes/pool_types.png          -- two-group (cyclic/non_cyclic) swatch grid.
  * out/palettes/pool_report.md          -- the contingency table + dedup report.

Sources / decisions (see report for the surfaced calls):
  * curated: every name scored 2 or 3 in labels/palette_scores.json, curve resolved
    from data/palettes/clean_colormaps.json.  source in {curated_q2, curated_q3}.
  * extracted: survey rows with composite >= 0.422 AND not near_dup AND not gate-`rejected`
    (== 583; the survey's net-new 603 minus the 20 gate/composite disagreements, which we
    now reject rather than keep), stored best-cycle form from
    data/wallpaper_harvest/palettes/<name>.json.  source == extracted.
