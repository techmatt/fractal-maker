r"""Atlas production discovery seeder — the standing discovery flow, per family.

Native-only discovery: the guided-descend engine's own root draw proposes depth-1
seeds; coverage is controlled by REJECTION SAMPLING over a point cloud of distinct
q3 outcomes (there is no atlas, no coverage grid, no per-cell cap). Per batch:

Family grammar (`--family` / `--julia --c` / `--phoenix`; see `resolve_family`): the
c-plane families (mandelbrot + multibrot3/4/5) run the full loop — the engine carries
the per-degree bands + degree_bbox flat-box, so only `--family` threads through. The q3
cloud is PARTITIONED by family (ledger `family` key): a d3 outcome and a Mandelbrot seed
at the same (cx, cy) are different parameter planes, so the radius query + startup
rebuild filter to the active partition. Julia is plumbed (fixed anchor, borrowed bands),
Phoenix is deliberately rejected (no parameter plane to prospect).

  draw native depth-1 seed  (engine root draw, ~96% descendability pre-gated)
    -> REJECT if >= Q3_DENSITY_CAP distinct q3 outcomes lie within REJECT_RADIUS
       of the seed's (cx, cy); else accept  (test is FREE next to one descent)
    -> depth-2 descendability probe  (reuse prescreen.prescreen, verbatim engine step-1)
    -> full guided-descend walks      (--seed-list --per-walk-rng, production config)
    -> k3 best-frame reward + outcome center + 1280-D v5 penultimate feature
    -> CORN-decode the k3-winning frame; a guard-passing class-3 outcome that is not a
       1.5*max(fw) near-dup of an existing cloud member joins the q3 cloud
    -> append every scored outcome to the durable ledger (distinct + dup + guarded)

Why rejection sampling: the descent (~seconds-minutes) dwarfs a point-cloud radius
query (microseconds), so burning many rejected seed draws to find one admissible seed
costs nothing next to one descent. The test runs BEFORE the descent, so a saturated
region's seeds are rejected before we pay to descend there. We test the *seed*
position against the *outcome* cloud; descent drift in (cx, cy) is bounded and
REJECT_RADIUS is set generously to absorb it. MAX_SEED_REDRAWS consecutive rejections
declares global saturation and stops the run cleanly.

"q3" = the v5 CORN hard-class decode == 3 (score_lib.corn_decode on the k3-winning
reframed frame), NOT a cutoff on the summed k3 = E[ord] scalar (two frames with equal
E[ord] can decode differently). k3 stays the reward/ranking value; class-3 is the
admission gate. There is no q3 cutoff knob.

This is v1 production wiring: NO harvest->refit loop, NO atlas refit. The Mandelbrot
(cx,cy,fw) distance is the ONLY harvest gate — the 1280-D feature is logged, never gates.

    """Fresh-discovery Phoenix z-plane descent -> the RUN-SCOPED discovery ledger.

    The phoenix analogue of `_run`. Phoenix has no parameter plane, so it cannot ride the
    c-plane spatial radius-rejection loop (resolve_family rejects `--phoenix` under `--run`);
    instead it repeatedly descends the single fixed Ushiki z-plane and scores each outcome
    with the SAME guarded v6 scorer + per-degree t_good the c-plane `_run` uses. Every
    scored outcome is appended to the run-scoped OUTCOME_LEDGER (redirected by
    --discovery-dir) with the c-plane row schema (id / family=phoenix / decoded_class /
    p_good / t_good / guard_pass, + scorer_version=SCORER_VERSION stamped by append_outcome), so the
    orchestrator's per-cycle watermark (new_fresh_q3) and fresh-isolation assertion admit
    phoenix rows exactly like the other families and build_fresh_discovery renders them as
    the 9th family (gs.render_family("phoenix") -> outcome viewport, no c).

    Writes FRESH to the run-scoped ledger — NEVER the banked GATHER_DIR/phoenix subtree
    (reusing banked q3s would violate the fresh-generation precondition). Phoenix is a
    low-yield, variety-poor garnish (~7 descents / keeper at t_good=0.18), so the
    orchestrator gives this phase an elevated per-cycle descent budget; dominance is capped
    downstream by build_fresh_discovery's family-balanced round-robin.

    Bounded by --budget (minutes) and/or --phoenix-walks (total-walk cap; 0 = budget-only).
