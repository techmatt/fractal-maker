# --- decode-version stamp guard (discovery outcome ledgers) ----------------
#
# A discovery-ledger row's `decoded_class` is the PERSISTED q3 hard-class verdict
# (corn_decode of raw_top3), stamped at harvest time by whichever classifier the
# seeder ran, via `scorer_version` (the version dir of the active checkpoint —
# "v6", "v7", ...). Historically production_seeder began stamping only partway
# through the gather runs, so a body of older rows carry a v5-vintage
# `decoded_class` and NO stamp (the entire `gather/mandelbrot` and `gather/phoenix`
# partitions, the first chunks of multibrot{3,4,5}, ~237 rows of the main
# `outcome_ledger.jsonl`). More generally, a verdict from a NON-CURRENT classifier
# must never be consumed where a current-model readout is required (fresh-discovery
# emit, wallpaper-head "fresh machine-q3" selection).
#
# Discriminator: `scorer_version == <active version>`, where the active version is
# resolved from tools/scoring/active_ckpt.ACTIVE_VERSION — the ONE source of truth
# for what "current" means. A row whose stamp differs is decoded by a different
# (older) model and its `decoded_class` is not a current verdict. This is an
# explicit stamp field — no path/source inference needed. When the active checkpoint
# is flipped, the meaning of "current-decoded" moves with it automatically, and
# previously-current rows (e.g. every v6-stamped row after a v7 flip) correctly read
# as not-current — that is expected, not a bug.
#
# READ-ONLY: this guard REJECTS stale rows; it never re-decodes, re-stamps, or
# mutates a ledger. Re-decoding stale locations under the current model is a
# separate, compute-bearing project and out of scope here.

# (59 MB field dump + GIL-serialized numpy), and it breaks cross-batch coloring
# consistency and reproducibility. The dump-field tail is correct only for

# bootstrap / preference path, which is its own canonical recipe and out of scope.
