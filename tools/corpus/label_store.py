"""Shared label resolution — the single source of truth for "what score a row has".

A batch's hand labels live in ONE of two places:
  (a) merged into its images.jsonl `label.score` (via tools/corpus/merge_scores.py)
      — the loose0 / rev4 / rev4occfix batches; or
  (b) ONLY in a `labels/*.json` sidecar keyed by image_id, because the merge into
      images.jsonl was never run — the Julia (`julia_ladder_j0`), `mining`, `scale`,
      and the two jm-band revival batches (`jm3_band`, `jm45_band`).
A loader that reads `label.score` alone silently drops the (b) batches: for Julia
that wiped out the entire family (0 Julia locations), and it dropped the mining/scale
Mandelbrot labels too.

Every consumer that turns a corpus row into a label MUST route through this module —
`corpus_reader.iter_labeled` (the version-blind trainer view) and
`query_sampler.LocationPool.from_corpus` (the q2+q3 location universe) both do — so the
resolution logic + the `SIDECAR_LABELS` registry live in exactly ONE place and the two
can never drift. NEW unmerged batches MUST be registered in `SIDECAR_LABELS` (or have
their labels merged into images.jsonl); `assert_sidecars_joined` makes a broken join
loud at load.

REFERENCE for the complete label set: the v5 unified classifier's training-data
assembly, tools/v5/build_manifest.py. It recovers the J0 Julia labels from
labels/location_labels_julia_ladder_j0.json JOINED to the batch's images.jsonl by
image_id — exactly the join mirrored here. See data/label_corpus/CORPUS_SCHEMA.md.
