"""Data assembly + location-disjoint split for the bootstrap palette-preference scorer.

Read-only on the label store and query records. Assembles per-query tiered
candidates into a Dataset whose unit is a *query* (6 candidates forwarded
together), and provides a location-grouped 80/20 split so no location leaks
across the train/val boundary.

Sources (read-only) — v2 unions TWO batches, each a (batch dir, label store) pair:
- coldstart_v2  (data/queries/coldstart_v2/ + data/queries/labels/coldstart_v2.json)
  raw 6-of-draw pools: wide good/bad spread.
- warmstart_v1  (data/queries/warmstart_v1/ + data/queries/labels/warmstart_v1.json)
  v1-concentrated queries: fine good-vs-good top-end resolution.
The two batches are location-disjoint by construction. Each label store maps
per-presentation tiers (good/okay/bad); each record carries location +
query_type + candidate image paths (relative to its batch dir).

Only the *pass-1* (base/authoritative) tiering is used. The 20 consistency-repeat
second passes (pass==2) in each batch are excluded from training/eval — same
location+candidates would double-weight and leak.
