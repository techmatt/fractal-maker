"""Per-location render sampler: for one location, produce a ranked top-18 "good pool"
of rendered-colorings (palette + params) under the v2 scorer.

This builds the PER-LOCATION stage only. No meta layer, no cross-location diversity
selection (that's a later layer's job — global diversity is deferred by design). The
within-location v2 ranking is the honest signal here: every render in a location's
search shares the location, so v2's within-query ranking is valid and score comparisons
*within a location* are meaningful (the ranking-only head is non-comparable only ACROSS
locations). No absolute good/bad cutoff exists (the head is uncalibrated) so the pool is
just top-18 by within-location score.

Everything reuses the warmstart generator / pilot / colormap seams — no coloring path is
re-implemented and no fractal is recomputed per candidate:
  * once-per-location ss2 field dump + cache (assemble_queries.ensure_field, out/fields/),
  * cheap recolor of the cached field (colormap.render_candidate + stretch_field prep),
  * the sampler's palette/param draw (query_sampler.sample_candidate — correct cyclic vs
    non-cyclic knob handling),
  * feature-space farthest-point over the 777 pool (palette_features.distance_matrix +
    farthest_point_order),
  * v2 scoring via the scorer's own data.build_transform(train=False) + train.build_model
    loading data/queries/scorer/v2/model_best.pt (reuses query_batch_gen.score_frames).

Algorithm (per location):
  Stage 0  gen-0: draw 60 palettes by feature-space FP (diverse-by-construction — a bad
           random roll can't starve palette variety; palette exploration happens ONLY
           here, refinement never discovers a new palette), one random param draw per
           palette -> 60 renders, score all 60.
  Stage 1  beam: top-18 by v2 -> 18 palette-distinct lineages (fixed palette + best param).
  Stage 2  shallow refinement, SWEPT over R rounds coarse-to-fine: each round draw K=8
           param variants around each lineage's current best (round 1 broad, later rounds
           tighter — annealed width), within the fixed palette, clamped to valid ranges
           (perturb rev/gamma; phase/n_cycles for cyclic only). Per-lineage elitism
           (keep parent-or-best-variant) + per-lineage early-stop (freeze on a
           no-improvement round). One R=2 pass is run; R=0 (gen-0 top-18, the baseline)
           and R=1 are its snapshots.
  Stage 3  output: the 18 refined lineage-bests, ranked by v2, as re-renderable config
           records + rendered images.

The run is partly to MEASURE whether refinement earns its keep: the report prints
score-lift per round AND a visual before/after (the arbiter — is lift visible, or is v2
chasing its own variance on a weak within-palette axis?), plus a render-space movement
metric (gen-0 -> R=2 mean CIEDE2000) so numeric-only lift is distinguishable from real
change. No conclusions drawn here — Matt eyeballs the strips and sets R.
