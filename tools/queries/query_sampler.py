"""The sampler D and query composition — the shared candidate-generation front end.

This is the ONE module the labeling batch driver and the future inference sweep both
import. It never re-implements the coloring path: every candidate is a
`colormap.CandidateConfig` rendered by `colormap.render_candidate` (the field⊗colormap
tail). By construction, label-space ≡ sweep-space — both draw candidates from the same
`sample_candidate` / `PaletteSampler` here.

Three pieces:

  1. `LocationPool` — the q2+q3 location universe (both Mandelbrot and Julia families),
     read from the label corpus batches. Labels are resolved from the labels/ store:
     a batch's merged `images.jsonl` score, else its `labels/*.json` sidecar joined by
     image_id (Julia/mining/scale live only in sidecars). Mirrors the v5 pipeline's join
     (tools/v5/build_manifest.py) so no family is silently dropped. Uniform draw.
  2. `PaletteSampler` — draws palettes from `pool_colormaps.json` (777) with the
     stratification the raw pool demands: the cyclic stratum is ~95% extracted (582 vs
     33 curated), so a uniform draw would confound *source* with *type*. Within a type
     we draw diversity-weighted (farthest-point flavored over the trajectory features),
     de-duplicating the internally-redundant extracted set and over-weighting the
     sparse curated cyclics well above their pool frequency.
  3. `sample_candidate` / `compose_query` — the sampler D over coloring params, and the
     query-type axis (palette / param / joint) that assembles 6 candidates on one
     held-constant location.

Everything continuous is a named module constant so ranges are tunable in one place.
