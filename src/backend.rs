//! Precision backends behind a trait.
//!
//! The per-pixel iteration sits behind [`FractalBackend`] so the precision tier
//! is swappable without the render driver, coloring, or CLI changing. Two tiers
//! exist now:
//!  - [`F64Backend`] — plain `f64` escape time, fast, accurate while pixel
//!    spacing stays clear of f64's relative epsilon (~1e-13 of `|c|`).
//!  - [`PerturbationBackend`] — single high-precision reference orbit plus
//!    per-pixel `f64` deltas with Zhuoran rebasing; clean far past where `f64`
//!    quantizes (v1 cap ~1e300 magnification).
//!
//! Backends are built **per frame**: `maxiter` and `bailout` live in the
//! constructor, and perturbation also computes and stores its reference orbit
//! there. The `dc` argument (the pixel's complex offset from the frame center,
//! computed straight from pixel geometry — never as `c - center`) is the only
//! coordinate perturbation needs; `c` is the absolute coordinate the f64 backend
//! uses and is accurate only at shallow depth.
